Within maybe 10-15 minutes, I would exhaust their free content and would be pressed to upgrade to a pro account to learn any more. I thought about doing it for one of the apps even though the language i was looking for (C#) wasnt available yet.  Then I found this app and my search is over!  It does have a pro version like the rest, but it doesnt appear to hold back content from non pro members.  It also has waaaaay more content to dive into compared to the others.  I love that in addition to the learning/ module side, there is also a challenge mode that turns a tough subject into a game.  Then SoloLearn takes it a step further and lets users share codes they’ve been working on INSIDE THE APP and you can run them on your phone to check out how they work.

1,2022-10-04 05:42:31,"I liked your app a lot before you updated it and made it all advanced. My biggest issue is limiting the amount I can do in one day without paying. Also each module takes me a few minutes to lean and only being able to get through a couple before getting shut down and being forced to pay money or wait 5 hours to continue is respectfully quite stupid. I’m a 16 year old kid who wants to learn and doesn’t have a job to provide for your monthly fee. Limiting my learning by involving this annoying rule is a quick way to demotivate me from learning and using your app at all.

If you even care about my request which I don’t think you guys will because you guys want money. Allow me to work as much as I want for free and allow me to have infinite wrong answers because on times of desperation and when I am confused I can find the right answer and learn more efficiently by just getting the answer after I already failed once so I can figure out why I’m wrong. But NO I have a pop up screen blocking me from doing that after I get 3 questions wrong.

I hadn't even gotten through the third Javascript lesson yet before I got an alert saying that I'd run out of free practice. You could say just to go to my PC where there are more free resources available, but if I was readily able to do that, I wouldn't have bothered to find an app to help me learn. I have an infant who wants to be held at all times (and doesn't seem to like my office chair), and a requirement to learn Javascript for my job, so an app is how I'm attempting to make both work.
Don't get me wrong, I'm a big believer in supporting the developers of apps that serve me well, and this app does look like it *might* be quite helpful to me. It's just hard to properly rate an app's usefulness when some of what I find to be essential parts of it are locked behind a paywall, so I don't know if I can properly evaluate it for purchase. While I know that there's a free trial, I know that I will be auto-charged upon that trial's expiration, and I don't know if I'll want to pay yet. I'd be okay with the free trial if it didn't involve consenting to pay upfront, rather than waiting until the trial's conclusion to ask me about it.",3,False,AgentF0x,This app is NOT free,
3,2017-12-12 03:33:55,"I really do love SoloLearn. I first came across it on my PC and saw that it was a great site to teach me programming in various languages. Therefore, I decided to get it on my phone as well. It has been a great addition to my journey in learning and it will continue to be. There's some things they could be doing differently, though.

First off, I just wish they would listen to their community more and hear what they have to say. They come up with great suggestions and ideas for SoloLearn and they just seem to be ignored/forgotten, but I understand you guys are busy. I would just try to work on that a bit more. The last negative thing is that there is no Lua course. I have already grasped the basics of Lua and I have been looking for some informative/good tutorials, but unfortunately, haven't been able to obtain any.

Overall, this app and community is great as a whole. I definitely recommend it if you're a beginner to programming. It dumbs down things a lot, so it's easier to obtain knowledge.

10,2019-04-13 18:17:42,"Overall this is a fantastic app and a fantastic system to be able to learn any of the programming languages offered. I would highly recommend it.

The one problem, however, is that the Community Forums use a ridiculously small font size on any device, with no way of enlarging it. This makes it practically impossible to read at length, no matter whether you are using an iPhone or an iPad. I use an iPad mini most of the time and reading the forums really hurts my eyes (I am 48 years of age and I don’t wear glasses). Just look at the screenshot provided in the app’s own description! The font size in the Community Forum is tiny and there is no button or setting placed anywhere to change it unfortunately.

The reason that this is such a disabling factor is that the community forums are integral to making progress in this app and are one of the most amazing and helpful things! Discussions are available for every topic and for every question and every answer. And that is just the most helpful thing you could imagine as you try to learn a new language.

If you’re looking for an in-depth lesson on how these languages work then this is not the place for you. The lessons are very surface level, but are good for beginners. Whatever isn’t explained well is usually explained better in the comments.

The practice projects are pretty neat. They give you the basic practical usage. Of course tho, I recommend not using the built in IDE. If you have a computer then download visual studio or the recommended IDE for your language. The built in IDE only has so many namespaces, and doesn’t have each namespace fully integrated into its system.

1113,2021-04-09 22:23:23,"Not gonna dwell on praises, except to say that the app and the website are the best, and pro is worth it.

One day I downloaded this app and taught myself Python, and now I’m working in aerospace, coding in many languages including Python. This app has your bases covered. One day at work I suddenly had to learn C, and this app had it. Then I had to learn C++ and this app had it. Then Java, then web development, and this app had it. It even has tutorials for tools like git, and concepts like cryptography.

You won’t become a pro in any area with the app alone, but you’ll get the tools you need to make your ideas a reality.

A computer is like a free brain, you can use to think about and remember things you don’t feel like thinking about and remembering. A computer is not unlike having your own personal “Rain Man”... except this rain man does exactly what you tell him 100% of the time, even to your own demise, and he can telepathically communicate with other rain men.

With programming, you can automate any process, all the way down to the typing and clicking you do as a user (which is why you have to tell websites you’re not a robot). Find yourself in a loop of repeatedly clicking and dragging and typing? All in the same pattern? You can automate it.

1164,2020-09-05 16:06:48,"UPDATED REVIEW:
The developer seemed to have fixed whatever the ad issue was that I and several other reviewers pointed out. (Original review is below this one)

The only thing I find kind of odd is that the developer doesn’t actually publicly acknowledge the ad issue, just tells you to contact support. To what end? The issue is obvious?

Regardless of the obvious misstep by SoloLearn support in responding to reviews. As I stated in my original review, the app is quite good. I’ve used it a lot over the past several months and there’s a lot to like and it works fantastically as a means to support other more thorough learning methods (videos, books, mentors, etc.)

I definitely recommend the app as someone looking to add a mobile resource to their learning routine. 

My main suggestion to the developer is to give more time on the challenges and require the authors of the questions to add descriptions and explanations to help aid learning and not just offer competition. 

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
The newest update added a pretty awful feature. 

Ads that can’t be closed or skipped. You sit there looking at the ad thinking it’ll close in 30 seconds or so like every other free app... but no, you can sit there until the zombie apocalypse, it will never close. 

So now I get to force close the app every time I complete a section. 

All kidding aside...

1188,2019-03-05 20:26:03,"Before I give my overall review, I’d like to say that I haven’t fully finished any of the courses and I haven’t gotten a feel for every last thing on this app.

So... this is a great app. I think that it helps people learn how to program with ease. Another pro is that you can interact with other users. Also, this program covers many different languages. I like the wide variety because I can learn both front-end and back-end.

Of course, it can’t be perfect, and it definitely isn’t. For one, the tutorials don’t completely cover each language. I feel like I don’t always get a full explanation of the uses for different commands. In addition, I feel like the approach to new concepts is a little boring. I wish that there could be examples of a pretend company’s website using that type of command. Lastly, half of the attributes taught in the HTML course aren’t even supported in HTML5. I think that this should be fixed and geared more towards the attributes that are actually supported in HTML5.

Overall, I wouldn’t recommend this app to someone who’s first learning to program. I used this to refresh my memory of programming languages that I had used in the past. I would recommend this app to anyone that’s revisiting programming languages.

In my opinion, some of the things that the developers could do to improve this app is to make the things taught be updated to what’s supported in the more recent versions of programming languages. Also, the courses should go more into depth on the languages instead of barely touching on a few things. If there was an interactive tool inside of the lessons with a real world example, then I’d be very happy.

1233,2020-09-21 18:31:10,"Let’s start with what they got right:
1) the app is well structured and it runs relatively fast 
2) It has good systems for engaging the learner to make them want to keep learning programming (this is both a pro and a con as you will come to realize.)
Now, here’s what they got horribly, horribly wrong:
When you start out, you have the option to learn for 5,10, or 15 minutes a day. I chose 15 minutes. After 15 minutes of learning Python went by, I got a pop-up notification:
“Free learning time has expired.”
Free?
I clicked on the “keep learning” and it took me to a page about monthly and yearly plans. Ladies and gentlemen, this “FREE” app charges you to learn the languages they teach. 
To put this into perspective, let’s compare it to another free language learning app: Duolingo. 
Duolingo gets everything right. 
1) It has a simple yet effective curriculum
2) It uses ads and “Duolingo Plus” (extra in depth classes that you pay for on a monthly or yearly basis) to earn money
3) If you don’t pay any money to learn, YOU CAN STILL LEARN. You can learn for hours without paying a single dime. 

And now, here’s what SoloLearn does:
1) It is well structured like I said before
2) It uses ads and more in depth courses for money. 
However, it does something else. This is the scam part of this app:
3) If you want to learn what the app offers for free, you have to continuously pay them money. 
This is like going to a public high school (which are of course free) and being told that you “can” learn the material needed to pass your SAT, but only if you bribe the teacher.
This app does not need this feature to make money. They make plenty just from ads and advanced (and paid) courses. The “limited free learning time” feature is a plain cash grab and borderline scam meant to lure in people who don’t see that there are better options available. If you want to learn programming, I would highly recommend Khan Academy programming courses or Mimo. Only install this app if you enjoy wasting money for no reason.",2,False,fix world of tanks,Borderline Scam. Install at your own financial loss,

The app so far is great– it's beginner friendly and very step by step, and you're able to look at solutions for practices when you're stumped. There are comment sections on the lessons where you can find helpful information from other users. 

My only problems would be that the ""challenge weapons"" (what code you can use for special challenges) do not include Kotlin, which is the main language I am learning. Many of the solutions for practices do not include what the lesson taught (for example, the Kotlin practice example for filtering arrays does not use that command, instead going for forEach.) They do work of course, but it isn't helpful to see what you did wrong in implementing what you learned. 

A minor problem is there is no way to contact support within the app itself. There is an email and a way to do it through the site, but I would appreciate there being one in the app as well. I haven't contacted support for this due to forgetting my login information (the main reason I would like support within the app) so take it with a grain of salt as there might be a solution, but I bought the annual pro subscription and have not been able to access some of the features promised– the main one being seeing past errors in your practices rather than having them being locked.

I forgot about this $65 subscription (after tax) & after seeing it in my bank statement (but playing with the app for a couple days), i realized this was an investment, not a mistake. 

Sololearn has quickly grown to become one of my most used apps on my phone & it’s not because of the extensive library of courses, not because of the ability to create an account & save your progress, not because of the ability to add, train, and compete with your friends. It’s mostly due to the comment section feature that has been added to each section/page of each lesson! I love the extra little ‘tips’ everyone has & all the motivation they give each other. 

I’d say this app has made it to stardom in my eyes simply for the classroom aspect of it all. it sure makes it feel like i’m in a class setting, knowing that I can filter the comments by most recent if needed, having multiple Pro teachers within that comment section also helps in situations where you can’t understand the lesson.

I can’t express enough how natural I feel learning how to program through an app! I would have never imagined.

1410,2021-11-30 18:47:16,"This is a good app to learn coding, but as always, there is room for improvement. 

As part of the pros, you get to learn at your own pace (without the annoyance of running out of hearts to continue). In addition to that, there’s a whole learning community that you can ask for help in the comments section. It feels like a classroom group chat where people send how to reach the desired code and at times the actual code itself (can be considered a con if you intend to reach all solutions without giveaways). 

But as for the cons, it’s worth noting that an advertisement promoting SoloLearnPro continuously shows when reaching the Variables section (which is the third unit in Python Introductory course). This inhibits users abilities to further their knowledge of coding as learning to code requires hands on execution as well as Trial and Error. So by forcing the advertisement on users, the knowledge gained from that point moving forward is reading and occasional practice. It takes away from the example mentioned in the reading sections. For visual learners, it acts as a severe hindrance since it’s hard to retain an ample amount of words about coding rather seeing it in action. Also, a tutorial on how to return to the course learning section would be a nice touch. After reading the community posts and comments, it’s easy to get lost in it all. 

TL;DR 
So in other words, it’s like a written lecture where your college professor skims past each supplementary example slide that is supposed to accompany the lesson notes. Either you retain it or you don’t. There’s no examples shown after a certain point. Hence can be described as coursework or worksheet based learning. I hope to see the advert removed. Then, and only then can I rate this app five stars.

Edit: Upon scrolling through the comments and responses from the developers, I noticed something rather contradictory. The developers response to one reviewer says “that the entire content of SoloLearn is completely free” but in the app, a feature that was once free isn’t any longer after surpassing a certain point (From my experience it was Section 3: Python Variables.)

      I’ve been using SoloLearn for a while now (the C++ program) and it’s been great, I’ve learned everything that the program has given to me pretty well. However, when I get to the projects I always seem to hit a roadblock.

This frustrates me because the projects are such an important part of the learning process, and I want to be able to look back on a piece of work that I created and be proud of it. I usually can’t figure out what I’m supposed to do despite my best efforts to rethink the problem and go back in the course to brush up on things I’ve learned.

The Play Store via Android gives an ESRB rating of Teen (“Users interact.”) “Content is generally suitable for ages 13 and up. [...]” which is a much more accurate assessment of age-appropriateness.

MY PLAN IS TO PURCHASE! But already have a large issue

I’m using an apple Smart Keyboard to learn to code.  Having done some java and c++ in engineering college, I know how necessary a keyboard is AND an efficient program that doesn’t have timesinks.

My issue: once I engage any answer blank with my keyboard, the green button to submit stays completely disappeared, no matter where I tap or swipe on the screen.  Having gone through four Smart Keyboards in the last year I don’t want to have to mechanically disconnect/reconnect it every lesson in order to submit as to help the longevity of my keyboard. 

The ONLY other way to use the Smart Keyboard and get the Green submit button to pop up is to make sure the cursor is in one of the blanks, click the down arrow on my keyboard, then click the world symbol to bring up the digital keyboards, X out of that keyboard (screen touch), and only then the submit button will show. That’s what i mean by a time sink going forward.  

		-if y’all have a cmd/ctrl+”x” command to bring up the lesson submit button up, that would be awesome.  Ideally, imo the user should just be able to tab his way after his last blank to bring up the submit button.
		-the “bug” may be the full screen mode that is engaged once a blank has been entered (even once exited!) while a Smart Keyboard is attached. I love the full screen, foreseeing future python program lengths; there just needs to be a way out in order to click submit and continue to the next lesson.

	-just realized this is true of the other buttons that surround submit like hint & unlock

Thanks for your time & I’m hoping there’s already a cmd+”x” that you have ready for me,

I’m a pretty novice programmer, so the tutorials for learning Java have helped me a lot. My favorite feature after the compiler is the challenges, which have helped me hone my skills and practice.

My only real complaint is that the Java compiler has a few bugs - less than other compilers I’ve tried, and they don’t interfere too much in terms of running, but they can make the code look messy. Firstly, if you open a parenthesis or brackets, a second one pops up closing it (which is great), but deleting the first before typing anything doesn’t delete the second, and if you add another parenthesis to close out of habit, it just adds another parentheses. Also, tabbing sometimes produces inconsistent distances, or tabs on the wrong line. On a related note, the default template that appears when you start a new editor uses small tabs, but most times when you tab in the document, it makes a big tabs. One more bug is that if you hit enter and quickly start typing, it sometimes rearranged the letters you type. Undoing with control-z doesn’t work either. Sorry if I didn’t explain these well, I can explain better if you need! These are using the first iPad Pro with the Smart Keyboard, by the way.

The Q&A is well-moderated and the courses are in good detail for the most part. The playground is a great place to test your code. All in all, Sololearn is a great tool if you want to test something really quick, or refer to a course if you are looking for quick information. This is especially useful when you have the app.

However, there are one or two problems I might report here in order that it gets fixed. In the mobile app, when you have the keyboard down in a code and click the < arrow button, it sees I havent saved the code and asks me to name it and save it. This is really useful, because without it I would have had too many projects lost because I never saved. However, it never prompts you if you have the keyboard up. For example, I was working on a project for over an hour on my mobile, and was expecting it to ask me to save when I pressed the < button (I had the keyboard up) and it never prompts me to save so all my progress was gone, which I was not expecting to happen. 

Also, some courses aren’t complete. The PHP course is missing a lot of important shadings revolving around opening and closing files.

I had spent long hard hours staring at a simple python program wondering why it wouldn’t work. It was a simple program: you input into one file, and the program puts the result in the output file. What would be an easy file error fix took me hours to troubleshoot (who knew that file.read() closes the file, resulting in errors if you want to read the file line by line?).

Learning code is easy and fun through this app. Which now, is more ludic than the previous version because now users are encouraged to explore further into coding with featured games, a forum, and a coding platform (I think it’s IDLE) so that you may write your own code and save it. 

A complaint I have is that after getting a multiple choice question wrong, the answers are reshuffled. And in the heat of quickly realizing my mistake and wanting to quickly correct it to move on, I end up clicking on the wrong answer again because the answers were reshuffled a mere millisecond before I clicked on the right answer. I advise to remove the reshuffling since it’s frustrating and slows users down. 

Lastly, users want a responsive interaction. As for the drag and drop questions, it’s unclear to users whether or not the answer they’ve “picked up” is to be dragged or dropped because nothing happens when you press your finger on it. The word picked should increase in size, or even better, shake. Users will find a shaking element familiar, as they do when they drag and drop apps on their phone’s home screen (#ohhh).

1664,2018-04-14 22:06:10,"I really appreciate what this app is trying to do, but there are a number of things that really bothered me about it when trying to learn C++ and test code snippets:

1. iOS’ loupe is broken in the code editor.  It places the caret where your thumb is pressing, instead of the center of the magnifying glass, so you can’t see exactly where it will be located.  This is especially frustrating because...
2. The editor automatically adds closing parentheses, brackets, braces, and double quotes after the caret.  This is an infuriating “feature” that I turn off in every environment I use, and I haven’t found a way to turn it off here.  Because of this, I must relocate the caret on nearly every line, which when combined with item 1 makes this app completely useless as a mobile coding environment.

Regarding the lessons themselves.

3. I understand that c++ throws so much more at you than most other languages when you first step into it, and you want to simplify as much as you can, but I strongly disagree with how much the lessons insist upon the line ""using namespace std;"", which I've since learned is pretty widely agreed upon as bad practice.  Beginners should absolutely be exposed to using std::cout instead of cout in the global namespace, as it also serves as a handy reminder that the system header <iostream> needs to be included.

4. There needs to be a better way to skip modules.  By the time I installed this app, I was already familiar with most of what was covered in Module 1, and mostly needed to understand pointers and classes, but because I didn't know about prefix vs postfix increment/decrement operators and got one quiz question wrong, I had to trudge through 20+ quizzes consisting of ""type ""a"" into this blank: __"".

But if you are just someone who wants to learn the ropes, then get this! It’s free, it’s awesome, and it’s never been easier to learn coding on the go. Perfect for people who don’t have much free time. I would recommend completing this course before going into other more advanced online courses. It also has a great, extremely helpful community. Even after you’ve completed the course, there are still fun things to do such as the coding playground. Recently they added other lessons create by users which is great, and there are also coding challenges which are basically quizzes against other players. It’s also 100% free! No ads, no micro transactions, the whole package. So what are you waiting for? Anyone who is remotely interested in coding should get this app!",5,False,NosidamG1234,Amazing!,

My only complaint is regarding the offline content. I fly a lot for work and have been wanting to use this app while in flight. However not all of the courses seem to download. I can understand if some features are inaccessible while offline (like comments), but it would be nice to download an entire subject.",4,False,Ceweste,Makes learning code easy!,

1680,2018-02-05 02:14:25,This is the best solo learning app I’ve ever cane across on App Store!!! Despite the fact that this app DOESN’T have any adds!!! It is supper easy and the directions are so clear hat even a 10 year old kid could learn if he wanted to. It’s not just easy to learn it is FREE and each course is free which is an amazing opportunity for beginners. If you had to pay in order to progress in course I would’ve deleted this app a long time ago but the fact that you don’t have to pay even a single penny makes worth any time you spend on this app!! I strongly recommend anyone this app!! If there is anyone wondering if this is a good app I would say that there is a very small chance of finding the same app on the App Store as well as on Android Store!!,5,False,MBG_100,Best solo learning app there is!!!,
1681,2018-02-03 22:27:55,I’m a beginner and this is helping me a lot.This is an amazing app and if you really want to cod I recommend this app.You will have a lot of fun. I have been coding for like a month and I’m learning html and I now understand it.,5,False,(rygre)⑶（╹◡╹）,Amazing,
1682,2018-02-03 00:00:39,"First off, I would like to say that this is like lots of “learn to code on the go” apps.
The thing is, this one is ACTUALLY free and has no dlc. Also, those apps usually spend 10 minutes teaching you how to use ONE keyword like puts, print, or echo. Also, those apps don’t usually have places to actually use the language you learn. This app gives you lots of things to do even once you are done with the tutorial. If you wanted to learn one of the languages that this app has, I would recommend this app.

By the way, could you make it so that the output pictures work offline on the tutorials?

Five stars.",5,False,I need a better name.,Amazing app,

1684,2018-01-25 04:16:39,"When I started using this app I had just the fundamental ideas of how to code (came from a game that was played using simplified code), and now after not even completing the full C++ course I am making simple codes for things like a math test and a game of rock, paper, scissors. One of the things I really appreciate is that it provides a hands on learning experience right from the start (and I learn best by doing).

SoloLearn also has a good community where you can ask questions about coding topics and get help on issues you have with your code. You can also compete with other coders in challenges.

I love this app and check it more than facebook!",5,False,A Capella singer,Great App to Start Learning How to Code!,

1687,2018-01-11 01:58:32,"I THINK this is my first review, after manyyy years of compulsively spending way too much money buying apps and games.

This one is free, and I thought it would be too good to be true (since I have downloaded all the free apps available on the App Store, so i know the drill)..... BUT it is EXACTLY what it says it is... FREE. No “click to email all your co-workers to unlock the next lesson.” No “follow us on Pinterest and buy a mug to get a free preview of lesson 2.” No “95 hours to recharge and get to the next question.” No “5% sale on coins to purchase a 3% discount on diamond chests to purchase offline access for 24h” etc...
 
I’m only putting a low score so the developers read this. SO DOWNLOAD NOW....

PLEASEEE add the ability to have the code editor in split screen during the courses on the IPAD!!! 
Or allow split screen with other apps at least so we can learn and try it for ourselves at the same time, keep notes, not have to keep going back and forth, etc. I’d rather use your own code editor but you have to leave the lesson, leave the course, go back, click profile, click codes, etc etc to reach your saved codes. I have an app on slideOver and have been coding with it on top of the lessons, but its not the same!!!!

Maybe instead of having the discussion button/shortcut on the top right during the lessons, put a code button. Or allow us to swipe left/right/down/pinch/shake/whatever to be able to quickly access the editor. 

BUT, seriously thank you guys, and thanks to all the people who make the app better by adding their comments with tips and tricks in the discussion board. Mostly, thanks for making it free (for real!)

PS: If you add the split screen with the code editor as an in app purchase, I wouldn’t even mind 😩",1,False,j615,Hello world!,

You can also play ageist other user in a user. And if of this is free. FREE. And I haven’t seen a add yet it’s completely free. This is a great app for anyone who wants to learn programming weather it’s html java or Swift this app has it all.

Ps 
The one thing I would like to see them add to this test is a quiz that lets you refresh your knowledge on the languages you have all ready completed with out going back thought the the course itself something that ask you questions on all the knowledge you have gotten. But definitely still a 5 stars app.",5,False,eisstrum,best app for learning programming,

I have also been in very technical positions working at refineries, nuclear power-plants, and skyscrapers designing and programming their automation systems for the past seven years. My first degree is in Industrial Science, my second degree is in EECE, I have taken many Robotics and Automation courses for work, and I am currently pursuing my Computer Science degree at University of Michigan through their College of Engineering. And hand down, your language courses have taught more than many of the classes that I have taken. The only thing that I would add would be sectional homework where you have to write your own code from scratch. That's where retention of things learned comes into play. 

Thanks again!",4,False,Amarzec32,Learning more than my Comp. Sci. class at University,
