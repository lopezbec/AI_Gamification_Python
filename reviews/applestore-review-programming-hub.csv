I’m a complete noob in IT, programming, Coding, hacking, all of it. But, always had a huge interest in learning and knowing how to completely understand, build and use a computer, network, internet, virtual machines and websites. Though I don’t think I’m anywhere near knowledgeable enough to land any entry level job into any of the related fields, this app has really made learning the basics super user friendly and easy to comprehend. I’m not sure yet how in depth some of these courses go. But, I’ve started with the basics so far and can say I’ve grasped it all and retained most well. Which has always been hard for me. I bought the pro version, so I get certificates at the end of each course. I’m sure they’re not accredited with any sought after employers or firms but stepping stones towards the knowledge needed then applied in real life as practice would likely be sufficient in a year or two with consistent effort every day, multiple times a day in this app. I’m on day 2, completed 2 courses (fundamentals and SEO), I just started my 3rd (IT Basics) and don’t plan on stopping until every course is completed. Sorry for going on and on. Figured I could share as much as possible since I won’t be leaving anymore reviews on anything else for a solid 5 years or so.",5,False,Doug Parker - Hostile Ginger,"From the guy who never reviews apps & has NO background in computers, coding or related."

A wide variety of topics, most lessons are compact and not wasting anyone’s time, and clearer explanations than other apps.

To me, the point of language is to convey ideas, so it doesn’t matter if you use the wrong “your” or say ain’t, but some of these statements in here have to be read several times to make sense. Lots of typos. For bugs, my courses don’t track progress correctly. I refresh and the percentage hops around, even if I’ve completed the course. Completed courses don’t show up under completed. I’ve done six or seven and only one is there. I can’t change my name or picture even though I’m typing in my password correctly. I think the save button doesn’t work in the top right corner.

These courses don’t make assumptions, so while some of it may seem remedial, it’s also nice to know that they aren’t going to suddenly start speaking a language you don’t understand, leaving you lost and frustrated.

The feedback form isn’t obvious, but even when you eventually find it, it doesn’t submit correctly, meaning that there is no way to give feedback on the bugs.

I want to help with the advancement of medicine. But, I thought that programming language was hard to understand, or complicated, with all those tags and everything. I’ve tried some things. Did not work very well. So, I one day decided to browse through the App Store, bored, finding what could be right for me. But then, this app caught my very eye.

I thought that this app was another boring old app that is just like any other; repetitive, boring, and unteachable. But, I got it anyway, to see how it worked out. And do you want to know what I thought? This is actually fun and educational!

It breaks lessons thoroughly and easy. It gives you a mini lesson about that sub-lesson to that big lesson on this giant app. You guys made this app fun! I’m learning JavaScript, and it breaks it up step by step. No wonder it has so many 5 star ratings!

There is a little room for improvement. For example, where is intermediate? You go from beginner to advance. Where is that? There is no in between! Also, you could make more categories. It’s just tedious finding the course you want. Then, if you can’t find it, you have to search it, and what if you can’t remember the name! Please consider this as constructive feedback and not critical.

Anyways, back to the pros. Love the pictures to go along with it! It really helps with the research part if you wanna do apple or AI or C++ and so forth!

So, I love this app, and please make more!

*Better (>) economic value: is  relative to the cost of this particular subscription offer, compared to likekind in the top charts. 
*Expecting this educational experience to require the most amount of self discipline (to stick thru all the long course logs, for EACH skill desired. & I’m STILL excited! 🤩👏
*Extensive: this app offers the most 📑🗂 content for the least 💸cost. Including certificates of completion, after a daunting but incredibly thorough course log (which, the certificates of completion were a personal priority). However if you ARE GOING to pay MONTHLY INSTEAD Of annually or a lifetime cashout, then i *definitely recommend subscribing to something like “Knowin” 1st** since it is composed of much shorter & potentially easier courses that APPEAR to be designed as a prerequisite for completion before the purchase of something like this (in order to speed up the pace of completion when the duration has a direct affect on the cost per year etc.). 
*In general, it depends on personal priorities.. but when this opt was compared to the similar alternatives in the top charts, this one does come out a little a little bit longer per course, but the service provider does offer a ‘lifetime’ subscription option (which I selected in hopes they do not suddenly discontinue operations). Specifically, I chose the Lifetime opt. as it does not add direct pressure to the causative correlation between *time & money (as with monthly memberships).
*&uhhff 😯 I’m sorry! ...Although I am not *yet* a data scientist or programmer, I do still have my degrees in business science & economics, respectively.

I mean in a metaphysical sense, this app ultimately has Bad intentions. 

Sure, it wears a Good mask with its wonderfully design mask that gives you a hug after its pleasantly displayed dialogue about what programming is (not how to do it), and sure, there seems to be a great deal of 34.99 for lifetime access so you won’t get billed ever again. That also seems Good. There’s a broad range of courses so you can learn *about* whatever you like. That also seems Good. 

And then you try to learn, which can only theoretically occur after we have finished the free “what is Programming” lessons. There’s a reason for this, because the learning is literally clicking answers to a quiz, where you can always just change your answer and speed through. No *learning* takes place anywhere. No practical example. No code editor. No hint that we’re only here to learn about concepts, and pretty basic ones, from my C# experience. 

Would you have paid 34.95 for such a thing? Maybe you would have, but my thinking is you probably wanted to learn something instead of being hugged by your hand computer. 

Oh, maybe their c# class is only in development? Not according to other reviews here. 

Get this app if you want to relate to your children/grandchildren about what programming is, or maybe if you want to be a terrible CEO who ruins his company because he thinks he learned something. 

You lesson designers… I know you understand. I know it’s the bizdev creature. They’re gonna do what they’re gonna do. 

I know it’s not your fault either, overworked marketing person who is probably underpaid as well. 

But this product… and it is a product… it’s Bad. It hurts people by being deceptive more than it does by being ineffective, and it’s designed to do just that.

This app is incredible. I don’t like writing reviews but this gets an exception! I’ve tried Udemy, reading books, reading free pdf materials, and those drag my momentum since I have to sit down and really pay attention. With the app, I’m learning interactively. I’ve also took my learning up a notch by firing up my laptop and downloading VS Code by Microsoft to run the mini code that you learn from this app. I’ve also started taking notes on my Evernote app. I really love this app since it doesn’t force you to learn large concepts in one gulp and in one sitting. The best part is that once a concept is covered, you take mini quizzes (don’t worry if you get them wrong, they’re not graded as they are meant to help you solidify the concepts better.) And you can also start learning from figuring out if the code is good or not based on what you just learned. I take out this app whenever I’m waiting around as a way to kill time.

This time it took my progress for every single course I was enrolled in and multiple certifications from passed courses. Great information in the app and I like the layout. I don’t like that I paid for a pro membership for an app that can’t deliver on its basic premise of allowing someone to get additional certifications Update: Heard back from customer service who says it just “happens sometimes” and that everything will come back if I delete and reinstall the app, which is literally what I said I did as soon as it happened. It’s been multiple days, it’s pretty clear this won’t magically come back and I guess I’m out $35 and multiple certifications I paid for. Don’t recommend. App may literally wipe everything and then customer service may not read your email and say that I should just keep waiting even after days of it being broken. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Update: 7/25/2021 Contacting support has been worthless. The issue consistently keeps getting responded with “your certs will just return” I’ve now asked for a refund and if I don’t get one I’m calling my card and clawing back the charge. I’ve basically been run around in circles for about a month and any “fixes” they’ve said they’ve added has only made the situation worse. Now when I refresh the app it removes courses I’m enrolled in. Don’t buy this app. They don’t seemingly care about the quality issues in the app or customer service they have.
Update 8/1 - I think the additional canned messages from the developer asking me to reach out to the customer service team, the one that’s not been fixing my issue for over a month and making the situation worse is telling. Having working in CS I’m seeing no good processes here for proper escalations or handling of issues that have clearly gotten out of hand for a customer. It means there’s no actual fix coming nor do they actually care to track down the lengthy ticket thread and escalate it to someone who knows how to resolve the issue. My name here and in the ticket are the same, it wouldn’t take long for someone to search for it in zendesk. But I have no intentions of jumping back onto that wheel of pain when it’s abundantly clear your agents have already attempted everything and refuse to simply escalate me at this point.

Sometimes it wont connect on app or on web. Bought lifetime pro, and system will tell me its valid for 1 year. Customer support fixed the issue but next time i check its back to expiring in 1 year. If your using on different devices your progress will jump all over the place for example after completing a course and getting a certificate you may go on to your other device and it will show your course isnt completed on 1 or more courses completed already at 100% it will say 91% completed, after completing again you gain a duplicate certificate. At some points with very little explanation it can make a whole lesson confusing for example coding a web page and the lesson tells you to insert a certain code or edit part of the code but doesnt say where it belongs or where it needs to be changed in script as your trying to code yourself following instructions given by lesson.

As much as I love learning on this app, I have gotten tired of the bugs and they aren’t just 1 or 2 bugs but quite a few but until they are fixed I will be using use Grasshopper and Code Academy which have also taught me just as much in coding but offer fewer courses then Programming Hub.",3,False,MightyV11,Great but alot of bugs
