I recently had a hard time getting into my degree thanks to the change of pace COVID brought, and I was looking for a tutor originally but instead found this app. I am so glad I found it, this has saved me from paying for an expensive tutor and has improved my understanding of programming. 

There are minor bugs I have found, such as: when you get to certain points in the building of ‘your game’ sometimes you won’t be able to take an action (e.g. shoot a missile at the planet); also when you do the challenges, sometimes even if you click the correct answer it will say you clicked the wrong one and you’ll get it wrong either way. 

Overall amazing app and I would recommend this to any student or person who is trying to get into coding. I’ve spent thousands on professors that couldn’t teach what this app can.",5,False,ls_royalty,"Amazing way to teach, but some minor bugs",POSITIVE

Programming is difficult to learn and typos in the teaching material can lead to way more confusion. One example is in the js fundamentals “array” lesson.
