Our goal, in the grand scheme of things, is to encourage more people to get into programming through the comfort of their phones.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, we do offer to skip lessons or jump to the specific topic and more with our Programiz APP+ subscription for people who want to get the most out of our app.\r\n', 'modified': '2022-08-19T04:04:03Z'}","I wanted to try this app to constantly review/practice Python that I have studied online and SAVE my data.
