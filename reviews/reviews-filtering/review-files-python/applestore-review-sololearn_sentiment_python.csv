1499,2020-01-13 17:08:15,">>>my copy and paste from inside the app bug report

MY PLAN IS TO PURCHASE! But already have a large issue

I’m using an apple Smart Keyboard to learn to code.  Having done some java and c++ in engineering college, I know how necessary a keyboard is AND an efficient program that doesn’t have timesinks.

My issue: once I engage any answer blank with my keyboard, the green button to submit stays completely disappeared, no matter where I tap or swipe on the screen.  Having gone through four Smart Keyboards in the last year I don’t want to have to mechanically disconnect/reconnect it every lesson in order to submit as to help the longevity of my keyboard. 

The ONLY other way to use the Smart Keyboard and get the Green submit button to pop up is to make sure the cursor is in one of the blanks, click the down arrow on my keyboard, then click the world symbol to bring up the digital keyboards, X out of that keyboard (screen touch), and only then the submit button will show. That’s what i mean by a time sink going forward.  

		-if y’all have a cmd/ctrl+”x” command to bring up the lesson submit button up, that would be awesome.  Ideally, imo the user should just be able to tab his way after his last blank to bring up the submit button.
		-the “bug” may be the full screen mode that is engaged once a blank has been entered (even once exited!) while a Smart Keyboard is attached. I love the full screen, foreseeing future python program lengths; there just needs to be a way out in order to click submit and continue to the next lesson.

	-just realized this is true of the other buttons that surround submit like hint & unlock

1638,2018-06-19 17:09:38,"SoloLearn is really good- you get tons of coding courses for free. I’ve been using it for about two years now and it has rarely failed me. I recommend it first to anyone who asks me where they should learn to code. 

The Q&A is well-moderated and the courses are in good detail for the most part. The playground is a great place to test your code. All in all, Sololearn is a great tool if you want to test something really quick, or refer to a course if you are looking for quick information. This is especially useful when you have the app.

However, there are one or two problems I might report here in order that it gets fixed. In the mobile app, when you have the keyboard down in a code and click the < arrow button, it sees I havent saved the code and asks me to name it and save it. This is really useful, because without it I would have had too many projects lost because I never saved. However, it never prompts you if you have the keyboard up. For example, I was working on a project for over an hour on my mobile, and was expecting it to ask me to save when I pressed the < button (I had the keyboard up) and it never prompts me to save so all my progress was gone, which I was not expecting to happen. 

Also, some courses aren’t complete. The PHP course is missing a lot of important shadings revolving around opening and closing files.

I had spent long hard hours staring at a simple python program wondering why it wouldn’t work. It was a simple program: you input into one file, and the program puts the result in the output file. What would be an easy file error fix took me hours to troubleshoot (who knew that file.read() closes the file, resulting in errors if you want to read the file line by line?). Just these small tidbits of advice in the courses can save programmers lots of time.",4,False,Bill1971MD,"Its great, some problems though",,POSITIVE,python

I took a python course in college and Istill thought this app was very useful.,5,False,gomezdan15,Finally,,POSITIVE,python

Example:  I have a gaming program I created with python and it asks questions as u go along to the point you have no idea what to input because, every input as multiple various outputs",4,False,Lycas25,Room for improvement,,POSITIVE,python
1696,2017-11-29 22:17:47,I just started using it to learn python. So far my experience is great!! There is nothing like it on the App Store and I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to learn to code. Plus it's free.,5,False,dhencksnnx,Amazing!!,,POSITIVE,python
