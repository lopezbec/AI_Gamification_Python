I recently had a hard time getting into my degree thanks to the change of pace COVID brought, and I was looking for a tutor originally but instead found this app. I am so glad I found it, this has saved me from paying for an expensive tutor and has improved my understanding of programming. 

There are minor bugs I have found, such as: when you get to certain points in the building of ‚Äòyour game‚Äô sometimes you won‚Äôt be able to take an action (e.g. shoot a missile at the planet); also when you do the challenges, sometimes even if you click the correct answer it will say you clicked the wrong one and you‚Äôll get it wrong either way.
