Edit, 5 months later: I now have over 70 hours of DataCamp training. I absolutely recommend the service, however the mobile application lags far behind the web application. There is limited ability to learn through this app‚Äî there are only a handful of courses on the mobile app, where the web app has hundreds.  Hopefully they will continue to add new courses to the mobile platform as time goes on.

Programming really requires hand holding and practice. And you guys have held me steady. You guys are Day One friends; shout out to Hugo!! 

I am a hardware and networking guy. I knew nothing about Python 30 days ago, and now I am really comfortable with it. I keep coming back for more, it‚Äôs addicting. 

Coupled with this, I am doing some Linux stuff and some Wall Street Finance stuff. I want a better job period, and you‚Äôre putting on the path to success. After this, I will continue to practice and then go after Java and C++. Bring it on.

The courses are bit size video from 2-5 mins long and give you exercises to put what you‚Äôve learned into practice. I finished the Data Science for Everyone course within 2 days (2 hours each day) and it wasn‚Äôt overwhelming. 

I love the way you can practice what you learned and it helps you by explaining when you answered incorrectly and allows you to try again. It also reinforces what you learned when you answer correctly by summarizing the lesson in a few sentences.

19,2022-06-27 05:50:08,"I mainly use the app on my phone to browse and watch videos. However I‚Äôve found quite a few things annoying about the app. 
1) There is no full screen mode option. So if you glaze the edge of your screen at any point while viewing, the video will terminate. 
2) there is no fast forward or backward buttons. If you slightly press the wrong location on the bar to move the video to a new position then it‚Äôs game over, due to the reasons described above. 
3) videos do not retain positional memory. If you accidentally exit the video its game over. You‚Äôll have to manually find where you left off.

In terms put how the app functions-it works fabulously. Great functionality and user interface. The tracking feature helps you get momentum and track your work. 

I do wish the exercises were a little more challenging, meaning I wish they challenged users to recall and remember before providing answer choices. Multiple choice is how many review methods work. The problem is, when facing these questions and challenges in the real world you don‚Äôt have multiple choice. You want to strike a balance between stimulating reality and not making it to challenging. A good middle ground is asking users to think of what to do for a few moments before showing the options. The more the brain is working the more learning and recall is being reinforced. On the other hand, we often have a false sense of learning when we read over what we already know. It‚Äôs the feeling of reviewing but learners in that state aren‚Äôt really engaging or learning/remembering as much as they could. In the end you cannot make someone do this. They either just wait for the multiple choice to come through or choose whatever until they get it right. But still the app can help stimulate good learning practices; e.g. ‚Äúchallenge yourself!‚Äù Another practice that comes to mind is this: after getting a right answer there could be a follow up question - ‚Äúhow confidently did you know this? Swipe up for ‚Äúvery‚Äù down for ‚Äúnot that confident,‚Äù and if users swipe down it asks them to explain it out loud to themselves why it is true...something like that. 

Kaplan‚Äôs GMAT app also has a way of marking a red yellow or green on confidence and keeps the questions in the rotation differently.
