0,2017-09-29 04:15:45,"I wanted to learn coding during my commute. But so many free to start apps require a constant Internet connection, and my train is often stuck underground without service. I greatly appreciate that you can use Encode even offline. (It being offline also means that it can't load the ads, if you find that annoying.)

The lessons included are indeed simple, and I absolutely think if you're an intermediate study in JavaScript or HTML/CSS you won't get much out of this. But as a beginner cramming these lessons in to/from work, who was only ever able to make good old 90's GeoCities webpages at best, the bite-sized chunks it's broken down into makes computing language much easier for to process.

The extra challenges as reinforcement and the compound lessons putting everything together is worth the $4.99 unlock, but even if you're looking to just start learning for free you could do much worse than Encode.",5,False,jellocube,Perfect for beginners!,

2,2019-09-05 02:30:21,"So I learned all my basics for HTML and CSS through Encode (the previous name before Knowin) and I have to say I loved the interactive, hands-on, you-type-it mode that It had. But don‚Äôt get me wrong, this app is still very good at teaching the basics for coding in any of its available subjects. But just as someone who still remembers the very interactive mode of Encode, I do miss it. Personally it was better for me to type it out than to press buttons to questions. So if its possible to bring this back into Knowin, that would be awesome. Like I said awesome app that can teach you so much, I would just like to see that type-it-yourself mode back.

It also breaks things into very small chunks that are in and of themselves easy to learn, and then builds on.

I had gone to the App Store to update my apps and when opening the store I happened to glimpse this app as I was switching the screen over to download the updates. I‚Äôve been trying to learn programming for about a month now. So I went back and took a look at the app. 

I‚Äôve bought 4 books over the last month hoping each one would give me what I was looking for - the syntax of programming. They were all tedious and wordy and hard to pull out the nuggets. 

This app does just what I want it to do. I was happy to pay the $6 for the full app after paying more than $50 per book, this felt like a steal. And if you already get the logic but just don‚Äôt have definitions of the words, then this app is the place to go. 

The logic of programming has always been natural for me, but I didn‚Äôt understand what the words meant. Or why they were put in certain places...the if/else statements and the Boolean statements...these were all terms I‚Äôd heard, but no one had cared to define or could clearly define without fire hosing me. This app takes it in small, easy steps. I‚Äôm almost through all of it and I‚Äôve had it for less than 24 hours. I‚Äôve learned more from this app in the 4.5 hours I‚Äôve spent on it than I did from days and days spent in the books I bought.

If you're trying to learn web dev, this will teach you the basics but it misses a lot of key content. Mainly CSS3 offers a new way to layout pages called FlexBox, it's simplicity is leagues beyond floating divs like before. The fact that FlexBox isn't even mentioned is the reason for 2 stars. It's so crucial to modern web development that it should have its own chapter. 

Also, this app is lacking certain convenient features. Namely, it lacks the ability to move the cursor through 3D Touch. This is so convenient while editing text I'm surprised it's not included. 

One reviewer said, ""This app is the app to learn Java!"", but it's not Java it's JavaScript and those are two separate languages. This app will teach you: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The basics of each not anything too complex. 

Because it is lacking crucial content, I can't recommend this app. Of course, the app is very well structured and easy to use... so it has its merits. I would easily give this app 4-5 stars if it wasn't missing information that new web devs should certainly learn.

148,2022-05-30 14:38:05,"I am a total beginner at coding and downloaded this app, as well as a few others. I want to say before giving my complaints/suggestions that this IS a decent way to memorize how to code. It doesn‚Äôt feel so much like learning through practice so much as learning through reading. It‚Äôs still informative and teaches you to code and what everything (well, most things) is for and how/why/when/where to use it. 

First off, just a minor suggestion for the devs: this app doesn‚Äôt keep score or reward  your progress really, other than ticking off the lessons you‚Äôve completed, which is fine honestly, it‚Äôs certainly not a dealbreaker, but I think it does make learning apps like this more enjoyable and fun to use. 

Second, the lessons feel a bit condescending sometimes. The way the answers to the questions are usually just the value of one of the blank spaces of the code and you just tap it and it appears in the space, and a lot of times it‚Äôs just one space that needs to be filled in so it just feels like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point in me tapping the ONLY answer there is, and having it just appear in the blank space?‚Äù Feels a little kindergarten to me. And again, it DOES educate you on coding, it‚Äôs just more of a READING way of learning, like reading a slightly interactive book basically, where sometimes you need to fill in one of the sentences with the word(s) that belong there‚Ä¶literally. 

Third, and this is again just another personal opinion/suggestion based on preference, but the app just feels very plain and basic I guess is the best way to describe it. There‚Äôs just really no ‚Äúpop!‚Äù or personality to it. And I understand it‚Äôs an app about learning how to code, and code is often very plain and boring and concise looking, so I understand it not being anything crazy, I just wish there was a little more personality to the app and that it was a bit more interactive than it currently is. As mentioned above, there‚Äôs no reward or incentive for doing anything on there, which is fine, the learning of new things about coding is absolutely a reward in itself. However, it would be nice to have a little more feeling of connection and interaction with the app and a little more incentive and personality. 

I don‚Äôt mean to sound like a complainer just being captious about the app and picking it apart. I do appreciate the dev(s) taking the time to create this app to help people learn to code, because it is a nice little interactive textbook of coding information at this point, and it is appreciated being provided with that information. I just wish it didn‚Äôt feel so condescending and plain. With a few little tweaks I really think this app could be amazing because it does explain things very simply and easy to understand and learn. 

Thank you! If you made it this far and read the whole review, you‚Äôre beautiful and I wish you all the best in life and in coding!!! <3‚Ç¨><>

Consequentially, I can‚Äôt tell if the program simply moves too quickly without adequate explanation, or if I‚Äôm not retaining enough to follow well, but there are things being introduced I don‚Äôt fully understand because I‚Äôm still trying to figure out why part of the code looks the way it does.

UPDATE:  The interface annoyed me so much that I ended up removing the app. Putting the buttons in order and expecting users to click them (i.e.: you‚Äôre entering ‚Äòbye!‚Äô And the buttons are ‚ÄòB Y E !‚Äô In order) just makes it feel extremely boring, honestly. It doesn‚Äôt feel as interactive as it should and the inability to write the information myself just severely hindered my ability to retain anything it was teaching at all.

I don't recall what exactly it was, but it included the number 23, line, and syntax error. If this is supposed to be a feature, I find it extremely puzzling as to why it would be added as an error message to people just starting out with coding.

Soon after that, I clicked the hint button, or whatever you call the button that fills in the code for you, and I ran it, and it came out fine with the preset Charles Babbage. (Glad you put that in there, I was extremely inspired by his work on the analytical engine.) I guess I should mention that this is in JavaScript: Variables I. After that, I tried once more typing in the line of code, and fortunately, it didn't come up with the strange error, it came up with ""undefined"". I even ended up trying to replace Charles Babbage with my name, and it still came up with ""undefined"". Another thing to mention, was that it was completing the Topic.

I haven't progressed much more into the app after that unfortunate encounter, but I would like to say that the interface is very clean, simplistic, and modern, and it also is very easy to navigate, but there is a feature that I would like to see added, and that is to be able to close out of the text editor without having to press run. It's not a very big deal, but I believe it would help a lot of people trying to go back and see a previous example of what they are supposed to be coding without having to run their current code they have written.

I really hope to see this app progress, as I believe it has lots of potential, and can be beneficial to people of all wanting to learn how to start coding HTML/JS/CSS.

The app is clunky at best. You're better off looking at other Apps in the App Store.

It was a great idea, but unusable at it's current state. I'll keep it downloaded on my device. Right now, I'll stick with using Free Code Camp on my iPad. If you want to use an iOS app, try out Py, Mimo or SoloLearn.

They listened to this feedback and now you can move the cursor with the keyboard, iPad on screen keyboard (2 finger drag), & iPhone 3D Touch drag.

It falls short in that you're not able to easily copy and paste. Additionally, you don't have the ability to use a CMD+Delete when using a keyboard. It's just odd that you can't use standard keyboard shortcuts that work everywhere else in the OS.

I upped a star since you're now able to move the cursor, but that's just the start.
